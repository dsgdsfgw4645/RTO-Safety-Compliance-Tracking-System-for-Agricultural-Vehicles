# RTO-Safety-Compliance-Tracking-System-for-Agricultural-Vehicles

Goal: To enhance road safety by ensuring agricultural vehicles comply with visibility and 
safety standards, reducing accident risks on public roads

Design a system to monitor and enforce safety compliance for tractors transporting goods, 
specifically sugarcane, on public roads. The system should:
• Identify if the tractor has the required red cloth with a reflective cross marker on the 
back for improved visibility and safety.
• If this safety marker is missing, capture the vehicle’s number and automatically notify 
relevant authorities for further action.
• Include an alert mechanism for quick intervention, supporting safer road practices.
